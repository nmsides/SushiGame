# SushiGame
This is a local game that pulls up a GUI with a "sushi belt" that can be rotated.  As the belt is rotated, computer chefs 
create random sushi rolls that are eaten by random customers with various levels of pickiness.  As a roll gets older without being eaten, 
pickier customers are less likely to eat it.  On the right side, the user can choose different 
color plates (which increasing have price constraints) with sashimi, nigiri, or a custom roll.  As rolls are created by computer and 
human chefs, their budget drops when they use ingredients to make a plate and increases when a customer buys it and eats it.
